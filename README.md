COSC 490 Senior Project

### A simulated environment mean't to educate users about forklift operation

## ABSTRACT

This project was an attempt to integrate virtual reality technology and game development for the purpose of recreating a simulated warehouse environment where users could interact , learn, and improve their forking operating skills. Created with the unity game engine with code written in the c# language, EVERTECH is an exciting and engaging way to learn about forklift operation.

## OBJECTIVE

Our objective was to create an educational tool that will teach the user how to work a forklift.

## GAME MECHANICS

Once the project is opened in unity, the user will be greeted with a start menu. The start menu has two options. When you select 'practice' you will be loaded into a simulated warehouse environment. Once there, the user will be able to look around via the oculus headset and control the movement of the forklift with the oculus touch controllers. Different buttons on the touch controllers have been bound to various controllers on the forklift. Through a combination of button holding and pointing, the users is able to interact with the forklift. For example, by holding down the right trigger and orienting the touch controller correctly, the user is able to manipulate one of three levers as well as the brake. The three levers are responsible for the following operations. The left-most lever causes the forklift arm to lift and down. The middle lever causes the forklift arm to tilt. Lastly, the right most lever causes side to side movement of the forklift arm. The users will be able to move the forklift through the simulated enviroment lift/transport boxes from one location to another.

## Game Controls

Right Touch Controller: Trigger moves the forklift backwards
A Button: Moves the carriage up
B Button: Moves the carriage down

Left Touch Controller: Trigger moves the forklift forward
X Button: Rotates wheel towards the right
Y Button: Rotates wheel towards the left

## INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Must have unity installed, then download zipped folder from Github, open the unity hub and open a new project. Naviagate to the unzipped folder and open the project. Once you are in the project, build and run the project, it will bring you straight to the training scene, which will allow you to navigate in the VR headset. Using the controllers you are able to rotate, move and control the forks.
